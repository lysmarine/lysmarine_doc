# Hardware

Theoretically all SBC supported by Raspbian or Armbian should work.

The fully tested SBCs are :
* RaspberryPi 3B/4B
* PineA64 LTS (based on the Pine64so kernel)

64bits computers are also supported.

*If you wish to have your favorite SBC supported and have some time to do testing ...or have a spare to giveaway.
